I'm learning a lot about new technologies like Markdown and how to make gifs and linking them into another website.  I've not done this before and it's a new learning experience.

I'm learning a lot about teaching myself new technologies.

## What's the most interesting thing you've learned in class so far?

The most interesting thing that I learned so far is the copyright laws and how each artists has their own restrictions.  It was interesting to see what the copyright law was exactly because it's so widely used and argued about today.

I think I would like to work more on the specific technology in class.  Sometimes reading the tutorials we read by ourselves are more confusing than others and having more time to work it in class is beneficial.

I'd love to do less talking.
